Description of this Task

The Advanced Encryption Tool is a Python-based application designed to securely encrypt and decrypt files using modern cryptographic standards, primarily AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key). This tool ensures confidentiality, integrity, and safety of sensitive data while providing a user-friendly interface for both beginners and professionals.
At its core, the tool utilizes the cryptography library to implement robust AES encryption in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode. This mode introduces an Initialization Vector (IV) for each encryption session, ensuring that even if the same file is encrypted multiple times, the output is different every timeâ€”protecting against pattern analysis.
The tool is built with both command-line and GUI (Graphical User Interface) options: 
The CLI version allows advanced users to run encryption and decryption tasks quickly with command arguments.
The GUI version, built using Tkinter, offers an intuitive window where users can select files to encrypt or decrypt and manage key files with just a few clicks.

Key Features:

-AES-256 Encryption for strong file protections
-Automatic padding to ensure compatibility with block size.
-Key generation and secure key storage using Base64 encoding.
-Separate encryption and decryption modules for modular and secure operations.
-Cross-platform GUI that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
-Error handling for file access issues, key mismatches, and invalid inputs.

Use Case Scenarios:

-Encrypting sensitive documents like financial records or legal contracts.
-Sharing confidential files over the internet with an encrypted key.
-Adding an extra layer of protection for backups stored on external drives or cloud services.

Dependencies:

-Python 3.6+
-cryptography module
-tkinter (built-in with Python)

Future Enhancements:

-Password-based encryption using PBKDF2 (instead of key files).
-Key management system or cloud sync.
-File integrity checks using SHA-256 hashes.
-Drag-and-drop support in GUI.
-Logging and audit trails of encryption/decryption actions.
